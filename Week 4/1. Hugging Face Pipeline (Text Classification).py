# MAGIC
# MAGIC The Hugging Face transformers package is an immensely popular Python library providing pretrained models that are extraordinarily useful for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It previously supported only PyTorch, but, as of late 2019, TensorFlow 2 is supported as well. While the library can be used for many tasks from Natural Language Inference (NLI) to Question-Answering, text classification remains one of the most popular and practical use cases.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Transformers (formerly known as pytorch-transformers and pytorch-pretrained-bert) provides general-purpose architectures (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNetâ€¦) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) with over 32+ pretrained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between Jax, PyTorch and TensorFlow.
