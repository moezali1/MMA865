            <p>Many people believe that learning new skills is a young person’s game, but this isn’t true with chess. The game offers an accessible platform for everyone, regardless of age. Older adults often possess better strategic thinking capabilities developed over decades, making them uniquely suited for chess.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started: The Basics of Chess</h2>
        <p>Before you dive into complex strategies, it's important to familiarize yourself with the foundational elements of chess. Understanding the game’s basic rules, setup, and objectives will serve as crucial building blocks for your journey to mastery.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Understanding the Board and Pieces</h3>
            <p>Chess is played on an 8x8 square board, with each player controlling 16 pieces—1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, and 8 pawns. Each piece moves in its own unique way, which is key to creating strategies and responding to your opponent's tactics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Basic Rules and Objectives of Chess</h3>
            <p>The primary objective of chess is to checkmate your opponent's king, meaning it is under direct threat of capture and has no legal moves remaining. Players take turns moving their pieces, adhering to specific movement rules, and avoiding putting their own king in check.</p>
